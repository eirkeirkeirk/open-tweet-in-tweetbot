# Open Tweet URL in Tweetbot for Mac LaunchBar Action

![](./open-tweet-in-tweetbot.gif)

This is a simple LaunchBar action that will take a URL to a specific tweet, such as <https://twitter.com/eirkeirkeirk/status/727207820827860993>, and open that tweet in [Tweetbot for Mac.](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-for-twitter/id557168941?mt=12&at=10lpjW)

I wrote a [blog post about this](http://blog.erikphansen.com/open-tweet-links-in-tweetbot-with-launchbar/) with a little more info and background.

This is my first attempt at creating a custom LaunchBar action, so please point out all of the things that are sub-optimal!
